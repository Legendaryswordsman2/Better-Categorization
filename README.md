## Better Categorization completely overhauls the inventory, most default categories have either been replaced or split between multiple categories, the goal is to make scouring your inventory a breeze so you can find what you want when you want it.

### For those of you concerned, you can freely add/remove this mod from any world without any issues since Better Categorization doesn't actually add any new blocks/items, it simply rearranges the current items and changes categories.

Details:

Non essentials such as the glider, horizontal and vertical elevators, the monocular, etc have all been moved to different categories and those that remain in "Essentials" have been rearranged to make them easier to navigate.

Tools have been given their own category right after "Essentials" to make them more visible and easier to look at a glance.

Job blocks have been split into two separate categories, "Job Blocks" & "Advanced Job Blocks" to allow for easier navigation when searching for job blocks.

The "Defense" category has been split into four distinct categories, "Defense Night" which holds all the different night guards, "Defense Day" which holds all the different day guards, "Traps" which hold all the different traps in the game, and "Weapons & Ammo" which houses all ammo and weapons acquired throughout the game.

The "Consumables" category has been replaced by "Resources" & "Processed Resources", all items that used to be in "Consumables" have been moved to their respective category, on top of that "Ingredients & Luxury" has been renamed to just "Luxury" and all ingredients have been moved to either "Resources" or "Processed Resources".

The "Food" category has also been split into two different category, "Meals" & "Unprocessed Food" which now hold their respective items.

Added a new "Seeds" category to hold all different types of seeds in the game.

Various items within categories have been rearranged and some items have been grouped together, an example of this is in "Textiles & Research" where the flowers and chests have been grouped together.
